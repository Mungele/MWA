1.) setImmediate and setTimeout are called at diffent 
position in the event loop. if you have a callback method then the setImmediate
will be called before setTimeout which will be the last to be called in the stack
.If you do not have the callback method then the setTimeout will be called first.
There for depending of where you are in the event loop one method can be prefered 
than the other.

2.) process.nextTick is a I/O event that is stored in the priority queue in the 
I/O API, that is called with the highest priority . At any point in the event 
loop if there is an event in the priority queue then it will be executed first.
setImmediate is a I/O event that is placed in the event loop and is executed at
check position if the loop.
